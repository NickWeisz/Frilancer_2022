      <h1 class="title">Dark Souls</h1>
      <div class="header">
        <p>
          Dark souls is a series of action role-playing games created by
          Hidetaka Miyazaki of FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco
          Entertainment. The series began with the release of Dark Souls in 2011
          and has seen two sequels, Dark Souls II (2014) and Dark Souls III
          (2016). Other FromSoftware games, including Demon's Souls, King's
          Field, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, share several related
          concepts and are commonly grouped together as Soulslikes. Dark Souls
          has received critical acclaim, with the first game often cited as one
          of the greatest in video games. The series has been both praised and
          criticized for its high level of difficulty. By 2021, the series had
          shipped nearly 30 million copies.

          The games take place within a dark, medieval fantasy setting, where
          the player's character fights against knights, dragons, phantoms,
          demons, and other monstrous or supernatural entities. The accretion,
          loss, and recovery of souls is central to the narrative and gameplay
          of Dark Souls games. These games are linked through their setting and
          an overarching cyclic narrative centering around fire, and are linked
          through common themes and elements, including interactions with
          phantoms and battles with demons. At the end of each game, characters
          may reignite the "first flame" or allow it to fade, recurring a choice
          others have made before.

          The Dark Souls games are played in a third-person perspective, and
          focus on exploring interconnected environments while fighting enemies
          with weapons and magic. Players battle bosses to progress through the
          story, while interacting with non-playable characters. The protagonist
          of each Dark Souls game can have a varying gender, appearance, name,
          and starting class via character creation. Players can choose between
          classes, including knights, barbarians, thieves, and mages. Each class
          has its own starting equipment and abilities that can be tailored to
          the player's experience and choices as they progress. The player gains
          souls from gameplay battles which act as both experience points to
          level up and as currency to buy items. Souls gained are usually
          proportional to the difficulty of fighting certain enemies; the more
          difficult an enemy, the more souls the player will gain.

      <h3>Demon's Souls</h3>
      <p>
        Released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Demon's Souls is considered the
        spiritual predecessor to the Dark Souls series. It has also been
        described as a spiritual successor to the King's Field series of games,
        while at the same time being described as a separate entity "guided by
        differing core game design concepts." It also drew inspiration from
        video games such as Ico, The Legend of Zelda, and FromSoftware's Otogi:
        Myth of Demons, as well as manga such as Berserk, Saint Seiya and JoJo's
        Bizarre Adventure. Unlike its successors, Demon's Souls uses a central
        hub system known as the "Nexus" where players can level up, repair
        equipment, or buy certain items, before venturing into one of the five
        connected worlds. The "World Tendency" feature is also exclusive to
        Demon's Souls, where the difficulty of exploring a world is dependent on
        how many bosses have been killed, and how the player dies. The gameplay
        involves a character-creation system and emphasizes gathering loot
        through combat with enemies in a non-linear series of varied locations.
        It had an online multiplayer system integrated into single-player, in
        which players could leave messages and warnings for other players'
        worlds, as well as join other players to assist and/or kill them. The
        multiplayer servers were shut down in early 2018 due to inactivity.
